### Introduction
â€¢	EMR is a way of storing the records digitally. EMR improves quality of care, reduction in medical manual errors and improvd communication and interactions among primary care providers and patients. It also allows to track the patients medical conditions over time. So knowing the variables which influence patients online usage of EMR would be helpful in improving the online EMR system. So that's why, more than the prediction here we are trying to analyze what the variables are which influence patient online EMR usage. 

### Problem Statement
* Find out which are the most important variables which influence a patients online EMR usage.

### Data Source
* Hints Survey Form - National Institute of Health (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services)
### Technologies
* R programming

### Type of Data
* The dataset contains the information from Hints survey form

### Data Pre-processing
* Dealing wih Missing values
* Removing non-significant variables

### Algorithms Implemented
* Logistic Regression

### Steps Involved

* Manually prepared conceptual model using Hints Survey and found out the variables

* Prepared a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) on the variables obtained from the conceptual model

* Performed statistical tests on the conceptual variables to extract the most significant features. 

* Implemented Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and used Logistic regression on final variables to predict if a person is accessing EMR or not.
  
### Evaluation Metrics  
Recall (because we have less number of people in our dataset)

### Results and Conclusion
By analyzing the Hints Survey form, we have finally obtained the variables which influence a patients online EMR usage.
